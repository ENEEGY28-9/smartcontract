```

### ⚠️ ENVIRONMENT BLOCKER
```
🔧 Smart Contract Deployment: Environment issues
   • Rust version conflicts in Windows
   • Network issues in WSL
   • Anchor CLI compatibility

💡 SOLUTION: Deploy khi environment fixed
```

---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS (When Environment Ready)

### Step 1: Fix Environment
```bash
# Option A: Use WSL with proper network
wsl --install Ubuntu
# In WSL:
curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.18.4/install | bash
npm install -g @coral-xyz/anchor-cli

# Option B: Use Linux machine/VM
# Install Solana + Anchor normally
```

### Step 2: Deploy Smart Contract
```bash
cd game_token
anchor build
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

### Step 3: Initialize System
```javascript
// PDAs will auto-initialize on first call
node auto_mint_scheduler.js
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
```
🌐 Check Solana Explorer:
   • Program deployed
   • PDAs created
   • First mint transaction: +100 tokens
   • Distribution: 80 game + 20 owner
```
